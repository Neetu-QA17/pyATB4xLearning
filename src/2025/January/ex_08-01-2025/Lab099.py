# File Handling
# How to Read a text and write into a file using Python Code - with open function
# open("File_name", "mode")
# mode - how you want to open the file - 'r' reading mode (default)
# - 'w' writing the file through either creating a new file or truncate an existing one
# - 'a' for appending
# - 'b' for binary mode
# - '+' basically used for updating purpose(reading + writing)

# Read File

# Read Entire file using function - file_object.read()
# Read a single line from a file - line = file_object.readLine()
# Read all lines in a file/list - lines = file_object.readLines()
# At the end we have to close the file
