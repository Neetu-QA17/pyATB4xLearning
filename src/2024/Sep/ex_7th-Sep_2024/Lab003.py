# self - Concept in OOPS - which points to itself - ignore for now
# *args - Unlimited no. of arguments* - int, string, float, boolean

print("Hello", "World", "Neetu", "Good-Morning", "Lucknow")
print("Hello", "World", "Neetu", "Good-Morning", "Lucknow", sep="-")

# so now instead space is replaced with hyphen
# def is a keyword used to create a function

# end
print("Hello", "World", "Neetu", "Good-Morning", "Lucknow", sep="|", end="_")
print("3.14", "123", "TRUE")

# so now instead of next line it is replaced with underscore
